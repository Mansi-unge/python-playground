# Swapping Temperature
# You are building a temperature converter app. Sometimes, due to incorrect input order, the min_temp and max_temp values are swapped.

# Current values are

# min_temp = 40

# max_temp = 25



# Use Python tuples to swap them back to the correct order.

min_temp = 40
max_temp = 25


# Write your code here
min_temp , max_temp = 25,40
print(min_temp)
print(max_temp)
